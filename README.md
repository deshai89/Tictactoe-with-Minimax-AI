Welcome to our Tic Tac Toe Minimax Program!

How to use:

Once program is loaded, you have the option to select the game type.	

    1. Option 1. Clicking "AI" will toggle the AI controls and start the game. The button turns blue when active.
        a. If this is the first move of the game, the AI will place an X in a random square. This prevents the AI from making the same starting move over and over. 
	   If the board is not clear when the AI is activated it will then avoid the random method and use evaluation and minimax to determine its best move.
	b. Then it switches to the humans turn who will put an O on the board. 
        c. It will then switch and then the AI will use evaluation and minimax to determine its best move.
        d. Repeated until message declaring winner or tie. Game resets, board clears, and AI repeats the steps above unless you turn off the toggle. Button color turns back to normal state when toggle is off. 

    2. Option 2. Clicking "Human" will toggle the human game mode. The button turns blue when active.
        a. Player X and O will take turns placing their character on the board until a winner is announced or draw.
        b. Game will reset and the human game mode toggle remains on until turned off by clicking the "Human" button. 

The reset button clears the board only. The AI or Human toggle will remain on until turned off. 
You can start the game in AI mode and then turn it off during Player Oâ€™s turn. You can then click the Human game mode and take control of both players. 
Vice versa you can start the game in Human mode and then turn it off. Turn on AI mode and it will take control of player X when it is its turn.
